    "LOVE_TREE_PARTNER_DESC_2": "With the small, worn out hoe, he dug a hole in the Earth. He gently laid the sapling to the ground and using his bare hands, scraped the remaining earth to cover the precious roots. He gazed at the sapling saying a little prayer that it will grow healthy and strong. He prays that the fruits will be abundant so he can harvest and sell them in the market to feed his family and send his children to school. He can buy medicine for his ailing mother and some new clothes for his wife.",

We provide fruit tree saplings for the farmers to plant. Rural communities in India will be able to be self-sustaining and self-sufficient. Each sapling means more than just ecological diversity, it means giving rural farmers a better life. The community through means of agricultural cultivation and education will not only just survive, it will also thrive.",
    "LOVE_TREE_PARTNER_DESC_5": "Once the tree bears fruits, it will be harvested as a food source and it is also a means of earning some income for the farmer. It is truly a gift that continues giving. You will be able to see the progress of each LOVE Tree as recorded in the blockchain.
